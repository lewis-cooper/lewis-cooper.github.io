      <p class="about">
        Iâ€™m a second year BSc Astrophysics student studying at Cardiff University.
        I have a keen interest in data science with experience in programming in python.<br><br>
        I'm currently looking for internships and work experience in either the technology sector in data science or in physics research.<br>
        <br><br>
        I have technical skills in computation, in particular with Python, and have experience with high level mathematics (having achieved a first in my mathematics module). I have a strong understanding of data analysis modules for python, particularly numpy, matplotlib and pandas.
        Over the summer I created my first polished python project (a SUVAT Calculator), and have since been busy building more as I continue to teach myself the more complex side to Python.
        <br><br><hr style="width:50%">
        <p class="about">Over the summer I focused on further teaching myself Python by building small projects which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/lewis-cooper" style="color:#457B9D; text-decoration: none" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and also through participating in Bright Network's technology internship experience. <br> During the internship experience
        I learned how to build an 'Agile' project plan using the scrum framework in order to effectively plan and manage the software development life cycle of a new implementation of a facial recognition feature for a banking app.<br><br>
        I also had the privilege of newtorking with some industry leaders, including Google, Amazon, Accenture & Vodaphone from whom, I gained valuable advice and experience.<br><br><hr style="width:50%">
        <p class="about">In my spare time, I write for my blog, <a href="https://unixcast.com/" style="color:#457B9D; text-decoration: none" target="_blank">UnixCast</a>, which I created in the summer of 2019. After going through a stressful exam season at the time and trying to sort out my University application process, I decided to make an online resource for students to find  productivity, university/college skills and studying tips. I write about my favourite productivity techniques which I use to stay motivated with the hopes of helping out other students who might be struggling.
